# RobustOS
- A free and open-source aftermarket distribution, based on the Android Open-Source Platform(AOSP), aiming to give you the cleanest possible alternative and a perfectly stable, smooth and beautiful experience right out of the box.
- We aim to
    - Provide AOSP security patches, Linux and CodeAurora tags being merged within hours of its release, you are sure to receive the latest security fixes and updates on your device as soon as possible!
    - We work on the ROM to make it extremely stable; we believe in the user not facing any issues regarding their device, flash and forget.
    - It is a distribution that aims to be really minimalistic and beautiful right out of the box. We merge patches from master and other sources to give you the best performance out of your device.
    - The ROM doesn't ship with any sort of bloat, and many hardening patches are in the process of being merged to give you the most secure and bloatfree experience possible.
